## About Test
    
Created a small app to satisfy the test idea of creating your own bundle of challenges.

## Requirements

Docker and Docker Compose (nice to have Docker Desktop to see what is happening).

## Installation

In a command line :

>> docker-compose build
> 
>> docker-compose up -d
> 
>> docker exec -it test-conqueror-app bash install.sh

Go to your browser and see http://localhost:8000
